# Object-Detection
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 deep learning model and a laptop webcam. The system captures live video frames, performs inference using a trained YOLO model (.pt), and visualizes detected objects with bounding boxes, class labels, and FPS.

Running YOLOv8 on Raspberry Pi Camera
This project also supports deployment on a Raspberry Pi using the Raspberry Pi Camera Module for real-time object detection.
